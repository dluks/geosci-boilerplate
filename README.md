## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
#### Option 1: Create a repository from the template via GitHub
On the main page of the repository, click **Use this template** and select **Create a new repository**. 
![Screenshot of the "Use this template" button and the dropdown menu expanded to show the "Open in a codespace" option.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-77734/mw-1440/images/help/repository/use-this-template-button.webp)

Now simply clone the new project to a new local project directory.
```bash
git clone [new-repository-url]
```

#### Option 2: Clone the boilerplate project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dluks/geosci-boilerplate.git

cd geosci-boilerplate

# Re-initialize project with new history
rm -rf .git
git init
```

### 2. Install poetry and DVC.
Use `pipx` to install CLI requirements in isolated environments so to avoid dependency conflicts between the CLI tools and the project-specific requirements.
> [!NOTE]
> Omit `dvc` installation if you won't be using DVC for data versioning.

> [!WARNING]
> Update this README with the specific poetry version after installation to avoid conflicts during collaboration (e.g. `pipx install poetry==1.7`)
```bash
pipx install poetry
pipx install dvc
```

 >[!NOTE]
 > If you don't have root access, `condax` (a similar project) can be installed with:
 > ```bash
 > pip install --user condax
 > ```

### 3. Create a virtual environment
> [!NOTE]
> `mamba` is simply a faster implementation of `conda`. If you don't have `mamba` installed, `conda` will also work.

```bash
mamba create -n your-project -c conda-forge python=3.10
mamba activate your-project
```

### 4. Install requirements
This checks to confirm python and conda environment setup. If on Windows, or if you'd simply prefer not to use `make`, you can use `poetry install` instead.
```bash
make requirements
```

### 5. Configure pre-commit Git hooks (optional)
> [!NOTE]
> This project uses `pre-commit` to manage Git hooks. If you'd prefer not to use them, simply remove `pre-commit` with
> ```bash
> poetry remove pre-commit
> ```
```bash
pre-commit install
```
